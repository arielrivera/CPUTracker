Ok, I'm ready to focus on the Main , or home, section of the page. 

 The Main/home area or tab interface page has 2 sections a top section and a bottom section , for now lets focus on the top section, the bottom sectio nwe can do later, for now the table in the home are we'll move down a little to make room to the top section which should be as follows:

  1- A top section we'll call top topbar where we have the following controls in horizontal form, or inline fashion :
  - Mode toggle, a toggle to similar to iOS toggles, to toggle between search mode or input mode.
  Search mode should be default mode when the web app is loaded.
  When toggled to input mode, the app adds records to the database. When in search mode the app searches the database. 
  - A search box mostly intended to search for a serial number, but also a part number can be searched or a combination of serial number and part number can be ebtered to do a search in the SQLite database. The search box accepts searches for partial serial numbers.
  The search box has to detect whether the user is searching for the following 3 cases:
  I- A serial number, either a full serial or partial serial number, this string can identified if the string does not contain a dash or an underscore. Be mindfull that only alphanumberic characters , undersocre and dash are accepted in the search box.
  II- A part number, this can be identified by a string that contains only a single dash and no underscore.
  III- A special string that contains the serial number and the part number separated by an underscore, here is an example "9KQ5064X20158_100-000000346" , where the first part of the string is the serial number and the second part is the part number. When a special string like this is entered and the focus is lost from the search box the app has to attempt deconstructing the string, leave the serial number part in the search box, try to identify the part number and autoselect it in the part number drop down , if not found

        - A Dropdown where to show all the different part numbers. Should have always a top option and defaulted as "Any". If the toggle is in input mode, and the dropdown is set to "Any" in case it was not set or auto identified, should be set to "100-000000000"; if we're in search mode then when searcing in the database then and the droopdown is ANY then the query should look for any in the part number field.

        - A Search button . This search button changes its legend from "Search" in the default color to "Add" in red color, depending on the mode it's set with the toggle.







        Lets create a function for when the string in the searchbox detects an underscore on the blur event as follows: 
        Lets call the function deconstructSearchString()
        If the underscore is detected then we call this new function that will attempt to deconstruct the string and leave the serial number, which is the part to the right of the underscore, in the search box and try to identify the part number, which is to the left of the underscore,  and select it in the dropdown. 
        If the part number is not found in the dropwdown then the dropdown should be set to it's default value "Any"

        =---  SEARCH Mode

            - ENTER or CLICK on the search button 
                --if regultar string , call SEARCH TOUTE
                -- if Special string, call deconstructSearchString , deconstructSearchString should call SEARCH ROUTE

            
       =--  ADD Mode
            - ENTER or CLICK on the ADD button
                -- if regular string, call ADD ROUTE
                -- if Special string, call deconstructSearchString, deconstructSearchString should call ADD ROUTE

        I need to implement pagination in home.html  search results table.
        - The table should show a max of 100 rows per page, and the user should be able to navigate through the pages with a pagination control at the bottom of the table.
        - The table should show the total number of rows found in the search query, and the number of pages.
        - The table should show the current page number and the total number of pages.
        

      
         Lets now focus on adding functionality to the search results page in home.html. 
        1- I want to be able to edit the fields serial number, part number, datecode,country and result  in the search results table. 
        If I double click on any of these 5 I should get a modal with a form to edit these 5 field at teh same time.
            --Serial number should be an input box to type manually , it should only accept alphanumeric characters.
            --Part number shuld be the exact same dropdown as in the search form. 
            --datecode should be an input box to type manually but implement something where as the user types it suggests other datecodes in the database that match the string typed so far, based in the distinct datecode field in the units table. 
            --Country should be a dropdown with these countries: Malaysia, China, USA.
            --Result should be a dropdown with these options: Pass (NFF), Fail (VF), Scrap (VM/PPS), Unknown.
        2- There should be a button to save the changes in the modal form, and a button to cancel the changes.
            -- When the save button is clicked we need to show a spinner while the changes are being saved to the database, and then show a message that the changes were saved successfully if so.
            -- If the changes were not saved successfully we need to show a message that the changes were not saved and why. For example, the serial number field has unique constraint so we should catch any failures like that and warn the user if so happens or any other errors.
            -- When the cancel button is clicked we need to close the modal and not save any changes but warn the user, if there are unsaved changes, that the changes were not saved.
            -- When the modal is closed we need to warn the user if there are unsaved changes that the changes were not saved.
        3- There should be a button "Show test logs" that when clicked shows a separate modal with a table of the test logs telated to the LOGS table but will define this later, we'll come back to this later. 
            The table should show the html table taht we'll define later.  
            The table should have a button to close the modal.
